# EmbeddedAI NOV25  
### *Running an Image Classification Model on the Edge with Hardware–Software Co-Optimization*

Welcome to the **EmbeddedAI (Q2 2025)** repository at the **University of Twente**!  

This repo contains the **template code and setup** for your final project. Use it as a **baseline**, and then use your creativity to **optimize, experiment, and enhance** the model using what you’ve learned throughout the course.

---

## What’s Inside

Each folder in this repository refers to each platform such as the Kria, Jupyter Notebook and the server. Each folder comes with its own `README.md` to guide you through that stage of the project.  
You’ll find baseline scripts and configurations to get you started — it’s up to you to add the *magic* ✨ of optimization!

---

##  Course Flexibility

The services and tools shown here are **suggestions**, not rules!  
For example:
- You can train your model in **Google Colab** instead of the UTwente JupyterLab.

---

## ⚠️ Important Note

> This repository is a **vanilla baseline**.  
> You’re encouraged to **implement your own hardware–software co-optimizations** using methods learned in the course or found in external documentation.
